<P><B>What's new in version 3.00?</B> 
<P>(1) The core part of this toolbox is now based on <A 
href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/">LIBSVM</A> version 2.33 <BR>(2) 
It can be run on Windows, Linux (x86), Solaris, and HP-XP. <BR>(3) Two 
data-preprocessing functions are added, <I>Normalize.m</I> and <I>Scale.m</I>.

<BR><B>1. Why we are here?</B> 
<P>Although there are quite a few versions of SVM codes in different languages, 
including C, Fortran, Java, and Matlab, available on the web, we still found it 
is necessary to develop a new Matlab SVM toolbox. Matlab is one of the most 
popular research languages in the world. However, currently, the only Matlab SVM 
toolbox available is too elementary to deal with any practical problem, which is 
due to both its high memory requirement and slow computation speed. 
<P>Compared with other available SVM packages, our OSU SVM toolbox has the 
following major features: 
<P>(1) SVM Classifier implemented as Matlab toolbox enables its users take full 
advantage of the convenience of the Matlab platform. 
<P>(2) By virtue of Matlab's mex mechanism, this toolbox implements SVM 
classifiers in C++ using Chih-Chung Chang and <A 
href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin">Chih-Jen Lin</A>'s <A 
href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/">LIBSVM algorithm</A> (<A 
href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/copyright">COPYRIGHT_libsvm</A>). 
Consequently, it is so fast that it is comparable to all the available C-coded 
SVM packages in speed. Meanwhile, it inherits the memory-management mechanism of 
LIBSVM, and is capable of dealing with practical classification problem with 
huge training set. 
<P>(3) It is self-contained. That is, it does not request any extra optimization 
software packages to support it. 
<P>(4) It implements not only the fundamental SVM classification algorithm, but 
also two modified formulations, which are named <FONT 
face=Symbol>n</FONT>-SVM&nbsp; and one-class SVM classifiers. 
<P><B>2. Download</B> 
<P><U>Current version:</U> <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can download current version of 
this toolbox, along with a demonstration tutorial, from <A 
href="http://www.ece.osu.edu/~maj/osu_svm/osu_svm3.00.zip">here</A> (~850KB). 
<P><U>Previous versions:</U> 
<UL>
  <LI>For OSU SVM Toolbox 2.00, you can download this toolbox, along with a 
  demonstration tutorial, from <A 
  href="http://www.ece.osu.edu/~maj/osu_svm/osu_svm200.zip">here</A> (~950KB). 
  <LI>Mr. <A 
  href="http://www4.csp.ntu.edu.sg:8000/~ejwlu/MyHomePage/LjwHome.htm">Lu 
  Juwei</A> has successfully transplanted this a previous version (ver 1.10) of 
  this OSU SVM Toolbox to a UNIX system (Unix System V Release 4.0 or later 
  versions on SUN ULTRASPARC2 200MHZ). You can download this package from <A 
  href="http://www.ece.osu.edu/~maj/osu_svm/osu_svm110_unix.tar.gz">here</A> 
  (~397KB). 
  <LI>Mr. <A href="http://ab.get.to/">Abdul Sayeed</A>&nbsp; has successfully 
  transplanted this version (ver 2.00) of OSU SVM Toolbox to a UNIX system 
  (SUN4U, OS Version 5.7, SPARC, SUNW Ultra-5_10). You can download the 
  corresponding gunzipped mex files from <A 
  href="http://www.ece.osu.edu/~maj/osu_svm/osu_svm200_unix.tar.gz">here</A> 
  (~17KB). You need to replace those mex files in my package with these mex 
  files if you want use this Toolbox in the similar system listed above. 
</LI></UL>Hope you enjoy it. 
<P><B>3. Install and Learn</B> 
<P>After downloading the zipped file, you need to 
<P>(1) Create a subdirectory in your Matlab's toolbox directory. (For example: 
\Matlab\toolbox\osu_svm\) 
<P>(2) Unzip the downloaded file into this subdirectory 
<P>(3) Add this subdirectory into the search path of your Matlab by "addpath" 
command, or by the "file-&gt;set path.." menu item, including the subdirectory 
of Demo. 
<P>(4) Run the command of "demos" from the Matlab command line to learn how to 
use this toolbox.
